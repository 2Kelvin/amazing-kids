            We gathered around for a quick catch up and head count. Then departed for a stroll around our beautiful
            museum.
        </p>
        <p>
            We walked in twos for each one of us to be accountable for someone during the day. which was in line with
            the
            theme of the day; friendship.
        </p>
        <p>
            The nature walk was breathtaking for most of us. We were mesmerized by the river stream, the beautiful
            bridge we walked through, the nature trails and most of all each other&apos;s company. After the morning stroll,
            teacher Brian engaged us in 2 fun games: The first one; <i>Tom, Tommy, Tommy Tommy</i>. Yes it was as fun as
            it sounds.

            For the second game, we split into two groups. The game; ‚ÄúA Battle of The Bible Verses‚Äù. Each group would
            get a period for discussion then pick their memory verse champions to represent them. Here are the memory
            verses presented.
