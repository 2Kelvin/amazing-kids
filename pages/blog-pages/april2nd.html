            Hello there. Nice seeing you here again. Put on your reading glasses, sit back and let us take you through
            the
            2nd of April.
        </p>
        <p>
            We arrived in the morning, said hi to our friends and teachers and were ready for the day.
        </p>

            We started with the devotion where we learnt about Lydia. We learnt how she was a successful business woman
            who sold expensive purple cloth in Philippi, Macedonia. She loved God very much. In fact, every evening she
            met up with some fellow women to pray to God together. All Lydia wanted was to attain things that were of
            eternal value. God answered her prayers and sent Paul, Silas, Luke and Timothy who were preaching across the
            sea from where she lived. She got baptized and invited the guys to her home to learn more about Jesus
            Christ. From this story we learnt that it is of high importance to seek God and things of eternal value as
            we live here on earth.

            The dance was here to wow and energize us for the morning. We carried on learning the dance song for the
            season and did some pretty cool gymnastic exercises just to spice things up a little bit.

            In the lesson, we did a recap of all the lessons we had undertaken since opening in January. We did this in
            preparation of a video shoot showcasing what we had achieved and learnt so far. Hereâ€™s a small snippet. The
            full version will be coming out soon on YouTube!

            We carried on with the energy we got from the dance to the playground as we had fun doing some acrobatics
            and gymnastic moves in the field.

            Project Time! We started on a new project namely, <b>Project Kites</b>. This was the first day of the
            project.
            Soon to be an amazing outcome. We believe it because we are the Amazing Kids and we believe we can do all
            things through Christ who strengthens us.

            We were up and ready for presentations, I hope you too can you tell! Our confidence levels were gradually
            improving; we were so proud of ourselves.
        </p>

            Of course, the Sherriff got the chance to give her remarks on our behavior during the day then went ahead to
            read out our marble counts. Hopefully someone wins the silver badge again next week. Guess you'll have
            to
            peek in next week to discover if someone did. Yes! We just got that ka-feeling someone will.
