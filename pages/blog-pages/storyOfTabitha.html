        <p>Bob Thurman said, <i>until you have real compassion, you can not recognize real love.</i></p>
        <p>Hello there 👋🏽. Let us take you through the day and also learn all about love and compassion.</p>
        <p>
            We start the day with a few interesting games. The two in particular that stand out are the “Broken
            Telephone” and “Concentration Game.” Here&apos;s the concentration game.

        <p>Nice right. Now let&apos;s practice the dance.</p>

            The devotion segment would stand out for the rest of the day. We learn about “Love and Compassion.” The
            teacher tells us the story of Tabitha to help us understand the topic well enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            We learn about Tabitha a believer who lived in Joppa. She loved helping people and more so through her
            sowing. She made for others clothes like shirts, coats and robes which made her a people’s favorite in
            Joppa.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, Tabitha fell ill and died. This brought sadness to the people of Joppa who knew her. They cried in
            grief remembering all that she had done for them. In the midst of all this, it came to their attention that
            Peter, a disciple of Christ was in the near-by town of Lydda. So, they sent out two men to go fetch Peter to
            come raise Tabitha from the dead through Jesus Christ. And so they did. On arrival, the widows showed Peter
            all the clothes she had made for them. Peter then cleared the room and prayed for Jesus to raise Tabitha
            from the dead. When he uttered the words “Tabitha, get up”, Tabitha opened her eyes and sat up. What a
            miracle indeed!
        </p>
        <p>
            From Tabitha&apos;s story, we learn to always love and help those around us as a way to shine our light on
            others
            as Christ has shined His light on us. To end the devotion, we give a few examples of how we can start doing
            good for others in our lives.
        </p>

        <p>
            After devotion, we then go for swimming yay! Then take our tea and snacks. After which we play another game
            called “Charades.”
        </p>
        <p>
            It&apos;s now time for the craft project. As you might remember, we started a kite project last Saturday
            which we
            are supposed to complete today. So we pull up our sleeves and focus.
        </p>

        <p>
            After completing our kites, we do our final prayers together then run out to the field to test out and play
            with our kites that we just made before our parents pick us up.
