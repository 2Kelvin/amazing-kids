            Hello there our amazing readers!! It is always a pleasure to share with you what we learn at Amazing Kids
            Club.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have been focusing on setting goals and gradually arming ourselves with the resources we need to attain
            them. This week our class was on Confidence. It is one thing to write down your goals and visulaize them but
            it is a whole entire thing to believe that you can actually achieve those goals. At amazing Kids our goal is
            to ensure that we groom children who have a great confidence in themslves and their abilities.
        </p>

            Our guiding Bible verse was from the book of <b><i>Joshua 1:9</i></b> <i>Be strong and courageous .Do not be
                afraid; do not
                be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go</i>. Moses who had led the
            children of
            Israel from Egypt had just died and Joshua was to take over as the new leader. This was quite a heavy task
            considering Moses had led the Israelites very well. Joshua must have been feeling overwhelmed and scared of
            the task ahead. God like the Good father He is affirmed Joshua and reminded him to be strong ,assuring him
            of His presence with him even in the challenge ahead.

            Sometimes we as children can doubt our potential, abilities and worth. We may feel insecure to do or pursue
            our goals. Our friends could laugh at us and make us feel discouraged or they could mock our abilities and
            ruin our self-esteem. It is important to identify your strengths and affirm yourself in those areas. Remind
            yourself how awesome you are ,tell yourself how you are going to achieve that goal. Stay positive and
            believe in yourself. When you have a positive attitude it is easier to stay motivated and keep going even
            when things get tough. Always remember that you are your biggest motivator and cheerleader.
        </p>
        <p>
            Surround yourself with positive people. Having a strong support system of friends and family can help you
            stay motivated and focused on your goal. They will help pick you up and remind you why you are working
            towards your goal.
        </p>
        <p>
            We pray that you shall be confident even as you pursue your goals. Share with us in the comment section what
            are some of the things you are doing to stay confident.
        </p>
