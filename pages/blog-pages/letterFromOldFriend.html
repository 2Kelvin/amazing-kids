            Ah, letters! There&apos;s just something about them that brings a feel good energy and gives a trip to memory
            lane of some good old times.
        </p>
        <p>
            On arrival on June 11th, The Amazing Kids received this amazing surprise in form of a letter with these
            beautiful drawings and words around it saying <b>I love Amazing Kids</b>. This thoughtful and kind gesture
            was so
            heartwarming to us. Probably one of the best ways to start a day. A letter from a friend who used to be part
            of us. Thank you Jasmine!
        </p>

        <p>Not wanting to cool the high energies, we played a balloon game.</p>

                    No discipline seems pleasant at the time but painful. Later on however, it produces a harvest of
                    righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.
                </i>
            </p>
            <p><i>Hebrews 12:11</i></p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Discipline is a key aspect of a human being. Without it there would just be disobedience and chaos. With
            discipline comes morality and knowledge of right and wrong. As kids, we need to understand that when we&apos;re
            corrected it&apos;s for our own good and the society at large. We shared examples and stories of indiscipline
            around the world and their consequences and through them learning the value of discipline.
        </p>
        <p>
            The money lesson was on <i>Communication Skills</i>. We learnt how to speak clearly to customers as this
            shows
            confidence in what you&apos;re selling and greatly improves the number of sales. To drive this point home, we
            engaged in an activity whereby we designed an ad/ poster for our business and stood in-front of the class
            describing what we just created.
        </p>
        <p>Here&apos;s a snippet of us doing the activity.</p>

        <p>and here&apos;s some short snippets of guys briefly taking us through what they&apos;re making.</p>

            We were preparing our boards for a string art project. Once we painted them, we left them in the sun to dry
            for a bit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Who said you can&apos;t have fun in between a project? We played a short <i>Broken Telephone</i> game as we
            waited.

        </iframe>
        <p>We then carried on with painting our second coat on the boards for the color to pop!</p>
