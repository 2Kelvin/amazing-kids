            In today&apos;s devotional, Teacher Elijah informs us about the love God has for us. This can be through
            protection, provision of food, shelter, clothing, good health and so much more. He really does love us and
            this is clearly illustrated through everyone&apos;s favorite bible verse: John 3:16.
        </p>
        <p>
            Guys are sharing their personal stories on how they have seen God&apos;s love in their lives, let&apos;s chip in. It
            seems that many have experienced God&apos;s love through His protection, interesting!

        <p>Today&apos;s lesson is on <b>Budgeting</b>.</p>
        <img src="../../images/blog/budgetting/budgetting2.webp" alt="Budgetting lesson" class="singleImage">
        <p>Teacher Kelvin is explaining this in a very easy and fun way to understand.</p>

        <p>So, a budget should be split into 4 main areas: <i>Spending</i>,</p>

        <p>
            <i>Saving</i>, <i>Tithing</i> and <i>Giving</i>. It should be divided in the percentages of 50, 30, 10 and
            10 respectively. Let&apos;s
            continue listening to Teacher Kelvin as he explains this.

            After learning, seems we have some budgeting scenarios to solve and present to the class. Luckily, we each
            get a partner to help out.

            for us to gather around and play some team-building games, let&apos;s go check it out.
