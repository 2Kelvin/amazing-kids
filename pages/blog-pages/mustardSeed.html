        <p>Hello there our beloved readers. We hope that you have been keeping well.</p>
        <p>
            We are so excited to start our new season where we will be learning about entrepreneurship and build our
            entrepreneurial skills.

            But before we start our self made journey it is important for us to understand what is money and how to
            appreciate it. Money is a medium of exchange in the form of coins and banknotes. Money can be good if you
            are good custodian or it can control you and make you a bad person. Therefore it is important to find a
            balance.

            As human beings we have different wants and needs in our daily life. Wants are desires we have to possess
            something while needs are necessities in our daily lives. We know the basic needs are food, shelter and
            clothing. These are the things that a person needs in order to survive. As we start a journey to appreciate
            and save money we therefore needs to identify the needs and wants in our lives.

            Is it possible to start making money at our young age? How do we do that? Yes it is possible to earn money
            at our young age. We need to create a habit of earning the money that we have instead of demanding it from
            our parents or guardians. We can help at home and do some chores in order to earn some money from our
            parents like washing their vehicles. We can also start small businesses in neighborhoods like selling
            popcorns or lemonades.
        </p>

            We were challenged by our teachers to create a business plan or come up with business ideas of what we can
            do or start doing. I am very excited to see the ideas some of my friends come up with.

            Our guiding verse was from the book of Luke 13;18 -19 that says ‚Äù What is the Kingdom of God like? What
            shall I compare it to? It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his garden. It grew and
            became a tree, and the birds perched in its branches. This verse encourages us not to despise our small
            beginnings. It may look small but it can grow and become something big.
        </p>

            At amazing kids our goal is to create wholesome learning experiences. We would like to nature the idea of
            appreciating and earning money at a young age. As well as growing a saving culture with the kids. Join us
            every Saturday in this journey.
