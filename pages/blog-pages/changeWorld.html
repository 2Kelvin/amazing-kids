            Nelson Mandela and Wangari Maathai are some of our heroes who are well known for changing the world. Wangari
            Maathai, one of our own, who had a deep love for nature and the environment believed that we could do better
            to improve it.
        </p>
        <p>
            She insisted that we as a country/ world, plant more trees and reduce cutting down of forests. She believed
            that by not doing so, “we are digging our own graves.” She really did love and believe in taking care of the
            environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            What do you think would happen if Mandela didn't stand up for the Africans? Or if our fore fathers who
            fought for our independence chose not to fight? Would we be where we are today? Would we be enjoying the
            freedom and the resources we are enjoying right now? Probably not!
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the significance of believing and standing up for a cause. It brings a lot of positive effects to
            not only you but also the world at large. People who deeply believe in something, are the ones who end up
            changing the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            You don't have to start big or do big things in order to change the world. Small deeds like collecting
            bottles and plastics off the ocean is changing the world by making the environment cleaner. In your own
            unique way, you can certainly change the world, may it be helping others, volunteering in charity causes,
            decorating other people's homes, being kind to others etc. This is how you influence others to join your
            cause and end up changing the world at large. Let's take a minute and listen to how these amazing kids will
            change the world.

            We'll echo again, everyone is unique and has the ability to bring change to the world in their own unique
            way. All you have to do is try. Don't worry about the whole journey, just think about that one step you
            going to take. For example, the caring kids who help out the needy probably started off by helping the
            elderly and friends in their neighborhoods before upgrading to help strangers and the world at large.

            What is that one belief you have that really makes you think if it were so, the world would be better than
            it is right now? Share with us in the comment section.

            Before we leave, here's a small background scene of the amazing kids explaining how they're making their
            'Change the World' posters.
