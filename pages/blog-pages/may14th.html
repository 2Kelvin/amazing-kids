            Painting, games, learning, fun and games were all the highlights of this day. Follow along to experience it
            too, through us of courseðŸ™‚.

            Did you know that King Saul was Israel's first King? This we learnt during the devotion in the morning.
            However, the main theme was on his success and failure. How after being so renown and praised by his people
            he fell due to his disobedience towards God.

            Still continuing with our theme on money, we learnt <b>Money Comes To Those Who Wait</b>. That is, having
            patience when finances are involved and most importantly avoiding the <i>Buy Now Pay Later Mentality</i>
            which
            could lead to a rabbit hole of debts in future.

            To challenge ourselves if we had surely learnt something from the lesson, we had this discussion.

            All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. We had plenty of time after to go outside, have a breather, play
            in the playground and field and also bond with our friends. After which we were so hungry and went ahead to
            take our snacks and tea back in class.

            Art sessions always bring a different vibe with them. In our case, it brings out the creativity, focus,
            attention to detail and most importantly the team-work skills in us.
        </p>
        <p>We prepared our canvases accordingly, for our first goal of the lesson</p>
        <img src="../../images/blog/may14th/may14th1.jpg" alt="Art preparation" class="singleImage">
        <p>then dove straight into painting for step 2.</p>

            The day was a success. We learnt and achieved our goals for the day. Prayers from 4 amazing kids were held
            as we departed thereafter with our parents for home.
