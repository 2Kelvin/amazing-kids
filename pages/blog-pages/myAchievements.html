            It is important to note that in order to accomplish something, you really have to work for it. Just dreaming

            For adults some common achievements can be: having a family, owning a successful business, being a famous

            stepping stone to higher and better achievements in future.

            Yes, sometimes you need to have a dream of the achievement you want to accomplish in future. We call this,
            having goals. Ones that you work on till they come true.
