            Hello everyone and I hope that you have all been keeping well. We at amazing kids are doing great . We have
            started a new series called Amazing Kids in the wild and its very exciting. In this series we get to explore
            the beautiful spaces in Nairobi.

            This week we went to the Arboretum. As the children entered the arboretum, we were immediately enchanted by
            the lush greenery and the sweet scent of blooming flowers that filled the air. We were greeted by a friendly
            guide who led them through the winding paths, sharing interesting facts about the different trees and plants
            they encountered along the way.

            As we continued with our journey, we stumbled upon a butterfly garden bursting with fluttering wings of
            various sizes, shapes, and colors. We were mesmerized as butterflies danced around them, some even landing
            on their shoulders and outstretched hands.

            Then we found a nice beautiful spot for us to sit in. We placed our shukas on the floor and started our
            morning devotion. Our study was about Identity. We got to learn that our identity is in Christ Jesus. He
            loves us deeply and he will not leave or forsake us no matter what we do. Never should we let our self
            esteem be put down because of things our friends may say about us. We should never feel like we do not
            belong.

            We had a tea break and our teacher had made some really nice sausages and tea for us. After the break we
            were paired into teams and started playing games. The games were really fun and interesting. We had such a
            fun day and I would really love us to go back to Arboretum.
