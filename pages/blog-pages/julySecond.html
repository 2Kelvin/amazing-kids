            Treasure hunts are fun, challenging and rewarding. The 2nd of July started with one in the morning. There
            had to be some entry rules; to participate, you had to do one lap around the field then join the search.
        </p>
        <p>It was going to be a two step hunt, and guys successfully completed the first one.</p>

            We then did another lap before heading to the final stage which was more rewarding and challenging than the
            one before. But we came up on top, shining and striving to find every candy no matter how hard some were to
            find.

            What an exciting session that was! We got to class and gathered around to pray. After doing a little catch
            up on how each person's week was, we sat down for a devotion session.
        </p>
        <p>
            We learnt the story of the prodigal son. We each took a turn to read a segment of the story in our own
            creative way.

            If you don't know the story, here's a clip of one of our own telling it from her own perspective.

        <p>A warm up session was due to keep those energies high.</p>

            We decided to shift and spice things up a little bit so we decided to do the craft project next.
        </p>

        <p>We clearly had achieved a lot so far so we took a much needed tea break.</p>

        <p>
            In the spirit of spicing things up, we had a lineup of fun games and activities to do in the field
            afterwards. We had so much fun in the bouncing castle
        </p>

            We finally finished the day off with the money lesson where we learnt about making a spending log and
            accounting on every penny you get.

            The day was a success but sadly it had come to an end. We prayed together then waved each other goodbye as
            we headed home.
