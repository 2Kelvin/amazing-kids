            We can all agree that the main goal of a business is to make money. And the only way to make money is by
            solving a particular problem in the community. Basic examples of businesses solving problems are:
            water-selling business in water deficient areas, entertaining others during their free time, offering
            medical services to the sick, starting a catering business to tackle the issue of people needing fast food
            when away from their homes etc. The list is endless and your creativity is your only limitation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Well you might be thinking, this is nice, but what kind of businesses can kids actually start? And the
            answer to that is, “PLENTY!”
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the business ideas for kids are, but not limited to: selling jewelry and clothing, face painting at
            events, baking, writing and illustrating children's books, babysitting, entertainment as a musician, gymnast
            or a dancer, planning kids' parties, selling art and DIYs etc. The list is endless.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just look around where you live and recognize a problem that most people have and then find a solution to it
            and make money from it. It could probably be that in your neighborhood most people have pet dogs, and they
            lack the time to walk them due to their busy schedules. You can then start your own dog walking business or
            offer your services to be walking their dogs when you're not in school. Sometimes it really is that simple.
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, to be honest, in some cases it's not quite that simple, ironic right! But hear us out, it's because in
            most cases you have to actually make a business plan and market your services/ business. Don't worry about
            it though, in the next few weeks we'll cover these concepts to make it easier for you to get started.

            In the meantime, the Amazing Kids shared about their business ideas and even came up with really cool names
            for them, let's watch. And oh, they had to put it down on paper for accountability purposes from their
            parents, teachers and themselves.
