            Trivia often push us to think just a little harder, a little smarter, and this one was no different. Time
            for a challenge, let us test you to see if you can solve these trivia. We believe you can do it! Okay
            let&apos;s
            go!

            And to our final challenge, brace yourself, this could be a tough one. Which animals are trained by the US
            army to disarm under-water mines?

        <p>Did you get any correct? We hope you did and also learnt something new if you didn&apos;t.</p>
        <p>
            The devotion rolled on to a video clip and discussion on Bartimaeus. We learnt the value of speaking out.
            Just like Bartimaeus did till Jesus heard him and healed him from his blindness. We learnt that no matter
            how many times people push you down and insist that your opinion isn&apos;t worthy to be heard, to keep
            fighting
            this negativity and speak out.

            <b>Be a Little Skeptical: Don&apos;t Buy Everything You See</b> was our lesson of the day. Amidst this
            advertisement
            world, we are bound to finally cave in to companies&apos; marketing strategies and end up buying stuff we
            don&apos;t
            really need. In this lesson we tackled all that and several ways to avoid this advertisement trap.
        </p>
        <p>Guys were elated to finally get a breather in the field</p>

            We know you know what time it is, Art Time! We made leaf cutouts and also painted the sun. The project was
            nearing to its end. The following Saturday we would put this all together to form one nice painting.
