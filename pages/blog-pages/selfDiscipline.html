            Have you ever been in a tricky situation because you waited until the last minute to do something; may it
            be, studying for your exams or doing your homework? If you've ever found yourself in such a scenario,
            self-discipline would have helped you out! This Saturday, we learnt about self-discipline and its importance
            in our lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            A person with self-discipline is considered strong mentally and emotionally. This is so because, thy are
            able to deny themselves the short thrill of now for the long lasting and satisfying results of the future.
            For example, someone who sacrifices their time to study hard reaps the fruits of success in future. Or even
            a more relatable example, a kid who reduces the amount of sweets and candy they take now avoids future
            visits to the dentist which are costly and to some very scary. This is the power of self-discipline.
        </p>
        <p>
            At Amazing Kids we're all about honesty. And these two guys shared with the class their stories where they
            thought they lacked self-discipline. Let's take a peek.
        </p>

            The financial impact of self discipline will be seen further down the road as we tackle more on issues
            regarding businesses and money. Those with self discipline end up putting a substantial amount of their
            earnings to savings while those who lack it waste all their money buying everything their heart desires.
        </p>
        <p>
            Self-discipline is a strength you have inside of you to control your feelings. It helps you do what is
            right, even if you don't want to do it. In this case, opening a savings account and denying yourself those
            expensive things that you desire now.
        </p>
        <p>
            With self discipline comes patience. Patience to wait till you save enough for that thing you've always
            wanted. It also brings forth wisdom. The knowledge that rough times will become worse if they find you
            without any money saved up since you squandered all of it buying things you didn't really need.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's take the example of having a tin full of cookies. With no self-discipline, you might eat all of the
            cookies at one go! With self-discipline, you could have two or three cookies today, then two or three
            tomorrow, and so on. This way, you get to enjoy the cookies longer instead of eating them all at once and
            risking getting sick from eating too many cookies at a go. Saving cookies to eat later is a good example of
            having self-discipline.
        </p>
        <p>
            Self-discipline also helps when you have a large project to do. You may not want to do it, but using
            self-discipline, you can work at it a little every day until it's all finished instead of waiting until the
            last minute. In the same way, if you have a chore that you don't want to do, using self-discipline to get it
            done first can get it out of the way so you don't need to worry about it anymore. Instead of playing video
            games or hanging out with your friends, and then doing the chore, finishing your responsibilities first
            shows self-discipline. You're able to do what you need to do first, then enjoy yourself later on.
        </p>
        <p>
            What a powerful phenomenon self discipline is. You not only get to use it now as a kid, but also when you
            grow up and become a responsible adult.
