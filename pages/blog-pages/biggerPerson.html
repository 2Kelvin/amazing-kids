            We have some brilliant students in this class. To sum up what you just said, the lesson was on ‘Being The
            Bigger Person&apos; and we learn this through the story of Paul and Silas when they were in jail. It could have
            been easier for them to let the guard harm himself after imprisoning them but they didn&apos;t. They encouraged
            him to live and chose not to flee so that he would not suffer the consequences thereafter. Wow what a story!
        </p>
        <p>Take a breather then come back for the life-skill lesson.</p>
        <p>
            Today we&apos;re learning ‘Money Responsibility&apos;. Join one of those groups over there and together discuss the
            money questions listed on the paper.Find solutions then come back together for one final discussion.
        </p>
        <!-- slideshow -->

        <p>
            We hope your take from the lesson is the same as ours; money is finite and should be spent wisely. Good job
            guys, you came up with really good solutions.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some picture printouts for you to color.</p>
