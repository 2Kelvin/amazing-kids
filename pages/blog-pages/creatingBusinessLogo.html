            A business logo is the face of your business. It identifies your business. When people think about your
            business, the first thing they see is your logo. Just the same as when you try to remember someone, the
            first thing you remember about them is their face.
        </p>
        <p>
            Knowing this, as a business kid who's been with us through the Amazing Kids' entrepreneurship classes, would
            you rather want your business remembered as an attractive business or just meh!? I bet you would like your
            business to be as beautiful and attractive as possible wouldn't you?
        </p>
        <p>
            You can design your own business logo from scratch: from the design to the colors, or you could hire a
            professional to follow your ideas and create a good business logo for you. Either path works fine. However,
            if you chose the hiring route, make sure to give your ideas to the professional on what you want in your
            logo so that it can be something that you feel a connection to. Because after all the business is yours and
            you'd better love the way it looks otherwise you are bound to lose motivation in making it successful.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're the brave ones who chose to create their own logo from start, make sure at the end to transfer
            your final sketch to a professional design platform for a professional look. You could ask your guardian or
            older siblings for help in this if you need to. Great logo design tools like <b>logo maker</b> or
            <b>canva</b> will do the job perfectly! PS that's what we as Amazing Kids used for this class and we are so
            proud of the end result.

            Before showcasing our business logos, it is of huge importance for you to know why having a good logo is
            good for your business. The most important aspect is that it grabs attention and attracts customers to your
            shop. Ultimately it's a potential customer's first impression of your business and separates you from the
            crowd. Here's one I bet you didn't know about, your customers expect it. The first thing customers always
            look for in your business is your logo. Therefore, this should be a motivation for you to create not just a
            logo, but a very attractive logo. It really goes the mile in making your business successful.

            Just as we promised, we'll show you the logos we made for our businesses. This should be an inspiration for
            you to go and make your own. If you do, do share with us here in the comments! Here's what we came up with!
            Amazing don't you think?
