                <p>
                    I'm a dance instructor with an experience of over 8years. Having been trained as a professional
                    performer from safari park hotel I have represented my country in the tourism department going to
                    show case the cultural richness of our country in various destinations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a trainer I focus on four major techniques which include: modern performance, introduction to
                    ballet, jazz, contemporary skills and fitness skills. While my emphasis is on correct techniques and
                    form I also stress on the importance of creativity, personal expression, dance history in an attempt
                    to mold the student into a well rounded artists regardless of there level of involvement. I
                    specifically use gospel music as my tool of engagement to tap on the spiritual growth and my anchor
                    is on <b>Psalms 149:3</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result I have come up with spiritual dance which involves modern dance, ballet, contemporary
                    and African dance movements all guided by one spirit. The movements can be described as soft and
                    angelic.

                    adventuring in the creative world of art. I believe that the only limitation you can have in art is
                    only your imagination.

                    As a Christian my belief is in God the father, God the son and God the Holy spirit. My desire is to
