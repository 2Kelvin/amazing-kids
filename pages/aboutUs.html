                <p>
                    I started Wendani Junior Academy in 2003 in Ruiru sub county after identifying a need and gap in
                    education and also to serve and give back to society. This I have achieved by sponsoring several
                    needy cases even today in various levels of education. The school expanded and opened another campus
                    in Juja sub county in 2014. Wendani Valley View School.
