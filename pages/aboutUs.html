                Through my bachelor's in Counselling Psychology, I have been able to counsel and work with people of
                all ages. Of which, I came to the realization that children are my most preferable group to work
                with. I just love being around children.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through my talent in art I have been able to venture into different art styles and mediums like:
                paintings, ballpoint-pen and pencil realism, fabric painting, spray painting and collage. I'm still
                adventuring in the creative world of art. I believe that the only limitation you can have in art is
                only your imagination.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to mentor kids to be the best version of themselves now and when they are older. To not
                only be a light among fellow human beings but also pleasing in the eyes of God.

            <p>
                As a trainer I focus on four major techniques which include: modern performance, introduction to
                ballet, jazz, contemporary skills and fitness skills. While my emphasis is on correct techniques and
                form I also stress on the importance of creativity, personal expression, dance history in an attempt
                to mold the student into a well rounded artists regardless of there level of involvement. I
                specifically use gospel music as my tool of engagement to tap on the spiritual growth and my anchor
                is on <i>Psalms 149:3</i>.
