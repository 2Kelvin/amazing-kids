                            Most arts and craft projects involve moving the hands and
                            fingers which improves the overall muscle strength and control over movements.

                            This makes a fun way to get your child fit without them even knowing it. It keeps them
                            active and engaged, and ensures that they are going to be getting fit and into the finest
                            shape possible.

                            It requires an understanding of your partner's movements. With the help of this teamwork,
                            your child will be far more likely to understand the importance of working as a team
                            together.

                        <p>
                            Your child will get a huge amount out of taking on dance lessons purely from the discipline
                            point of view, as well. This makes them more inclined to listen to instructions, to not
                            always expect their own way.
