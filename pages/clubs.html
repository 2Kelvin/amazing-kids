                            Most arts and craft projects involve moving the hands and
                            fingers which improves the overall muscle strength and control over movements.

                            This makes a fun way to get your child fit without them even knowing it. It keeps them
                            active and engaged, and ensures that they are going to be getting fit and into the finest

                            It requires an understanding of your partner's movements. With the help of this teamwork,
                            your child will be far more likely to understand the importance of working as a team

                            Your child will get a huge amount out of taking on dance lessons purely from the discipline

                            always expect their own way.

            <p>
                Courtesy of Center of Creativity Services, the C5 Spark Teens Connect is a Christian value based club
                for teens between 13-17 years with weekend and holiday programs that target to engrain positive lifelong
                skills in Teens through creative and engaging activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our teenagers face external and internal struggles between the ages of 13 to 19 years. These youngsters
                are expected to cope with different types of challenges and to mention but a few; hormonal changes,
                puberty, social, parental, academic pressures, peer pressures, and much more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many teens may feel misunderstood and it is vital that their feelings and thoughts are validated.
                Failure to do this may lead to even bigger challenges befalling the teens like: depression, stress,
                anxiety suicidal thoughts, unhealthy competition, bullying, drinking, smoking, underage sex, teenage
                pregnancy, early parenting, defiant behavior, social media addiction and
                the list goes on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Against this background, Center of Creativity Services
                felt there was a need to start C5 Spark Connect where
                teenagers can meet together in an atmosphere where
                they can freely self-express.
            </p>
            <p>
                C5 Spark Teens Connect is a place where they have an
                opportunity to feel at home, discover their self-
                identity, grow their faith, learn self-empowerment
                skills, explore their leadership skills, discover
                talent/become creative, build relationships, use their
                hands and mind in a fun, exciting and challenging way.
            </p>
            <p>
                The different issues facing them are tackled under the
                umbrella of 5C's: <b>Confidence</b>, <b>Curiosity</b>, <b>Courage</b>,
                <b>Creativity</b> and <b>Consistency</b>. From these C's topical
                issues that relate to key challenges facing the teens
                will be addressed in form of diverse modules and
                methodology.

            <h3><b>Treasure Hunt Series (August)</b></h3>
            <p>
                Each person is created with God given potential which involves aligning our
                desires and actions with God's will for our lives. Everybody has a God
                given desire to live to full potential but unfortunately, many people do not
                reach it as majority of the people are caught up in the everyday which
                becomes easier to continue, hence maintaining the status quo or
                succumbing to peer pressure.
            </p>
            <p>
                This results in people failing to lead authentic lives copying what is trending
                or popular in order to fit in. They give in to peer pressure especially with the
                influence of the social media.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the series, we cover different topics to help the participants to dig their
                very core to get the treasure that lies inside each one of them.

            <h3><b>Charting a unique path for my life series (November/December)</b></h3>
            <p>
                In a world where moral values have really become rare, and cut throat
                competition is in all aspects of life, we at Center of Creativity Services,
                believe that there is an urgent need for preparing our young to become
                unique and different, so that they can stand out and become the light
                increasing their chances of being picked out in a crowd for different
                positions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Under the unique path series, we develop programs that will help the children attain a competitive edge
                in whichever situation they may find themselves in.
