                    <li>
                        <b>Develop fine Motor skills:- </b>Most arts and craft projects involve moving the hands and
                        fingers
                        which improves the overall muscle strength and control over movements.

                    <li>
                        <b>Improves Hand-Eye Coordination:- </b>The more the children practice, the better their
                        hand-eye
                        coordination. This will help them in almost all walks of life.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Promotes innovation and creativity:- </b>Arts and crafts provide a platform for the kids to

                    <li>
                        <b>Helps in Socializing:- </b>Interacting with other children with the same interests gives the
                        kids
                        the opportunity to socialize and build friendships.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Gain Greater Self-Confidence:- </b>The freedom to express themselves through movement and
                        show
                        casing themselves before others helps the kids gain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Build Social Strength:- </b>Learning how to dance is that it allows your child to become more
                        comfortable socially.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Increase Fitness & Activity:- </b>This makes a fun way to get your child fit without them
                        even
                        knowing it. It keeps them active and engaged, and ensures that they are going to be getting fit
                        and
                        into the finest shape possible.

                        <b>Build Stronger Teamwork:- </b>It requires an understanding of your partner's movements. With
                        the
                        help of this teamwork, your child will be far more likely to understand the importance of
                        working as
                        a team together.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Improve Listening & Discipline:- </b>Your child will get a huge amount out of taking on dance
                        lessons purely from the discipline point of view, as well. This makes them more inclined to
                        listen
                        to instructions, to not always expect their own way.
